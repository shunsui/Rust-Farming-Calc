# Rust-Farming-Calc

Im beginner and my code will be probably like running aroud the target, so i will appreciate any feedback from you ppl. :)

About the project:
This is for now simple, GUI-less "Rust" cross-breeding calculator that calculate gene pool of one plant based on 4 other plant's gene pools.
It includes dominancy of bad genes ( X, W ) and 50/50 chances when in pool combination u find for example 2H and 2Y ( which are good genes)
in the same place - program will tell you that will be random one but in good-gene area. R mark tells you that gene will be totally random
because no doubles in combination. Well there is a problem for me cuz calculator will output R even if there is X or W in combination
which is 100& for a bad gene as they are dominant. Heard some rumours that bad genes have value 1.0, and good genes 0.6.
In that point we can clearly see that we need 2 good over 1 bad to do something that we could like. And yeah. Program will still tell
that 1 bad and 3 other different genes will outcome as random in crossbreeded plant.

Again if someone have an idea for solve that i'll appreciate.
